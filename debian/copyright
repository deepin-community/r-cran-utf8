 That license is the Unicode license from
 http://unicode.org/copyright.html . I don't include the character data
 verbatim, but I have a set of headers derived from them, for example
 https://github.com/patperry/utf8lite/blob/master/src/private/charwidth.h
 . These are generated from the python scripts here:
 https://github.com/patperry/utf8lite/tree/master/util .
 .
 I have listed "Unicode, Inc. (Unicode Character Database)" in the Author
 field per the CRAN policy, and I believe that the current package
 description is compatible with the Unicode license. If you have
 suggestions for how to better document the license situation in the
 package, please let me know.
